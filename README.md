# COMP 6781 Project: SemEval 2024 Task 8: Human vs. Machine Classification - Subtask A (Multilingual & Monolingual Tracks)

Project Overview
This project is part of the SemEval 2024 Task 8: Detecting whether text was generated by humans or machines. We are focusing on Subtask A, which involves classifying text as either written by humans or generated by AI models. Our approach covers both the monolingual and multilingual tracks, and we aim to improve on the baseline model performance (0.74 for monolingual, 0.72 for multilingual).

Team Members
Mithila: Focusing on the multilingual track.
Apurba: Focusing on the monolingual track.
We collaborate on fine-tuning and integrating techniques, and coordinate efforts to ensure the overall performance of the model is optimized.
