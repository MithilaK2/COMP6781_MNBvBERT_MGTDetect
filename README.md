# COMP6781 Project - Comparative Analysis of Multinomial Naive Bayes and BERT in Detecting Human vs. Machine-Generated Text

### Goal of the Project

- Compare Multinomial Naïve Bayes (MNB) and BERT-based models (including DistilBERT) for detecting human vs. machine-generated text using SemEval Task 8 and GenAI datasets.
- Through comparison, understand the complexity of detecting nuanced features in machine-generated text.
- Understand each model’s strengths and weaknesses.
- Assess the impact of hyperparameters on model performance.
- Compare performance across key metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
