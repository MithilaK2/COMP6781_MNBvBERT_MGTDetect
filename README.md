# COMP6781 Project - SemEval 2024 Task 8, Subtask A

## Project Overview
This project is part of **COMP 6781 - Statistical Natural Language Processing**. We are working on **Subtask A** of the **SemEval 2024 Task 8**, which involves classifying between text written by humans and text generated by machines. Our focus is on improving the performance of the baseline models for both **monolingual** and **multilingual** tracks.

### Goal
The primary objective of this project is to fine-tune the **XLM-RoBERTa** model and experiment with different fine-tuning techniques (e.g., PEFT, LoRA, Adapter Layers) to outperform the baseline accuracy.

## Team Members
- **Mithila**: Focus on the multilingual track.
- **Apurba**: Focus on the monolingual track.
